# Backlog

- Improve the names of the files we send to the user.
    - Apparently, we can't set the name of the file when we send it.
    - Consequence: when we download it, we must name it correctly.
    - MapDownloader may look locally before downloading it again.
- Edit the GPX file to rename the circuit with the name of the ride and the group.
- /cava can show more information, like uptime.
- Add a /rattrapage command.
    - The bot asks for either:
        - date
        - ride number
        - simply the previous ride -> maybe a /dernier command for this one
    - Then it send the maps.
